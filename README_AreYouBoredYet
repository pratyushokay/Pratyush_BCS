Are You Bored Yet?
A. Defining the Boredom Score
The boredom score was developed using five behavioral indicators:
Performance Drop Norm: A sudden decline in recent performance suggests decreased engagement.
Unrewarded Streak Norm: Extended sequences without rewards may lead to frustration or disengagement.
Reaction Time Drift Norm: A gradual increase in reaction times over trials can indicate cognitive fatigue or waning attention.
Choice Switch Rate Norm: Frequent switching between choices might reflect indecisiveness or erratic behavior.
Reaction Time Norm: Elevated reaction times could be linked to reduced motivation or attention.
To move beyond heuristic methods, Bayesian optimization was employed to determine the optimal weights for these features, ensuring they sum to 1. The final boredom score is a weighted linear combination:
Boredom Score = (0.101 × Reaction Time Norm) + (0.108 × Choice Switch Rate Norm) + (0.264 × Unrewarded Streak Norm) + (0.264 × Performance Drop Norm) + (0.264 × Reaction Time Drift Norm)
Higher scores indicate patterns of disengagement or demotivation.

B. Utilizing Behavioral Proxies
In behavioral sciences, it's common to infer internal states through observable behaviors, especially when direct reporting isn't possible—as with mice. The following features were considered:
Reaction Time
Stimulus Contrast
Trial Delay
Choice Switch
Unrewarded Streak
Performance
First Movement Delay
Quiescence

Some of these were directly available in the dataset, while others, like reaction time, were derived. These proxies help estimate levels of engagement or boredom.

C. Patterns Observed Across Sessions and Animals
Analysis of boredom scores across trials revealed:
Early Decline: High boredom at session starts that decreases rapidly, possibly due to adaptation or initial excitement.
Cyclical Patterns: Recurrent fluctuations in boredom, potentially linked to changes in behavior, reward patterns, or fatigue.
Late-Session Drift: A gradual increase in boredom towards session ends, indicating reduced motivation.
The distribution of boredom scores is right-skewed, with most values around 0.2 on a normalized 0–1 scale. Key observations include:
Predominance of low to moderate boredom levels.
High boredom scores (>0.6) are rare, suggesting occasional disengagement episodes.
Overall, animals remained generally engaged with occasional lapses.
