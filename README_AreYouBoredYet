Are You Bored Yet?
A.	Boredom Score Definition: 
 The used features are:
1.	performance drop norm – Sudden decline in recent performance is indicative of loss of engagement.
2.	unrewarded streak norm – Long sequences of unrewarded trials can increase frustration or disengagement.
3.	reaction time drift_norm – Gradual increase in reaction time across trials may reflect cognitive fatigue or loss of attention.
4.	 choice switch rate_norm – High switching frequency could reflect indecisiveness or erratic behavior.
5.	 reaction time norm – High reaction time could be associated with low motivation or attention.
To move beyond the heuristic and obtain a data-driven definition, I aimed to find the optimal weights for the 5 features such that the resulting boredom score correlates most strongly with it through Bayesian optimization. The weights were normalized to sum to 1. 
After optimization, the final boredom score was defined as a weighted linear combination of the five behavioral components:
boredom_score = ( 0.101 * reaction_time_norm +
                               0.108 * choice_switch_rate_norm + 
                               0.264 * unrewarded_streak_norm + 
                               0.264 * performance_drop_norm + 
                               0.264 * reaction_time_drift_norm)

Higher boredom scores indicate behavioral patterns where the animal is disengaged or demotivated.

2.	 Why certain behaviors were treated as proxies
It is a common strategy in behavioral sciences where a model is built or a score is calculated based upon multiple observable proxies where internal states cannot be objectively measured. Since mice cannot self-report their feelings, we rely on behavioral changes that may correlate with disengagement. While predicting boredom scores, I considered the following features:
reaction_time, stimulus_constrast, trial_delay, choice_switch, unrewarded_streak, performance, first_movement_delay, quiescence; some of which I took up as they were in the dataset while some were engineered such as the reaction time.

3.	Observed patterns across sessions and animals

Distribution of Boredom Score Over Trials
 
The following patterns can be observed:
•	Early Decline: Boredom is relatively high at the start of sessions and decreases rapidly, possibly reflecting adaptation or excitement.
•	Cyclical Patterns: Boredom exhibits recurrent fluctuations across trials, with periodic rises and dips.
o	These may correspond to behavioral shifts such as reduced reward, strategy changes, or fatigue.
•	Late-session Drift: A gradual increase in boredom toward session end is observed in several sessions, possibly indicating reduced motivation.

Analysis of the computed boredom scores across all trials reveals a right-skewed distribution, with most values clustered around 0.2 on a normalized 0–1 scale.
•	Key Observations:
o	Low to moderate boredom is the most prevalent state.
o	High boredom scores (> 0.6) are relatively rare, suggesting transient episodes of disengagement or fatigue.
o	This skew supports the idea that animals were generally engaged but experienced occasional lapses.
